# ðŸŒ¾ Rice Crop Disease Detection API with Streamlit

This project is a Machine Learning-powered web application that detects diseases in rice leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on 8 rice disease classes and provides the disease name, confidence score, and suggested remedies, including home treatments.

## ðŸ”¬ Disease Classes

1. Leaf Blast  
2. Leaf Scald  
3. Brown Spot  
4. Bacterial Leaf Blight  
5. Sheath Blight  
6. Narrow Brown Leaf Spot  
7. False Smut  
8. Rice Hispa  

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (for API endpoints, optional)  
- **ML Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Deployment:** Localhost / Streamlit Cloud
